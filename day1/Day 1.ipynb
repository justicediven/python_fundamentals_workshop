    "\n",
    "MATLAB does have some advantages, however. Integrated MATLAB tooling around modeling discrete/continuous systems and code generation ([Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)) is more advanced than what is generally available in Python libraries. Also, MATLAB toolboxes (e.g. real-time and machine vision) tend to be more suitable for research (and some industrial) environments where reuse is not as important.\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB has also recently implemented some pretty interesting [deep learning toolsets](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/deep-learning.html?s_tid=hp_brand_deeplearning) that, while can be built in Python, are easier to use and be productive with."
